Turn non-concurrent [FantasyLand 3][FL3] Applicatives concurrent.

Most time-dependent applicatives are very useful as Monads, because it gives
them the ability to run sequentially, where each step depends on the previous.
However, they lose the ability to run concurrently. This library allows one to
wrap a [`Monad`][FL:Monad] (with sequential `ap`) in an
[`Alternative`][FL:Alternative] (with parallel `ap`).

## Usage

```js
//The concurrify function takes four arguments, explained below.
const concurrify = require('concurrify');

//We load the Type Representative of the Applicative we want to transform.
const Future = require('fluture');

//We create a "zero" instance and an "alt" function for "Alternative".
const zero = Future(() => {});
const alt = Future.race;

//We create an override "ap" function that runs the Applicatives concurrently.
const ap = (mx, mf) => Future.both(mx, mf).map(([x, f]) => f(x));

//Calling concurrify with these arguments gives us a new Type Representative.
const ConcurrentFuture = concurrify(Future, zero, alt, ap);

//We can use our type as such:
ConcurrentFuture(Future.of(1)).sequential.fork(console.error, console.log);
```

## API

```hs
concurrify :: (Applicative f, Alternative (m f))
           => (TypeRep f, f a, (f a, f a) -> f a, (f a, f (a -> b)) -> f b)
           -> f c
           -> m f c
```

## Interoperability

* Implements [FantasyLand 3][FL3] `Alternative` (`of`, `zero`, `map`, `ap`, `alt`).
* Instances can be identified by, and are compared using, [Sanctuary Type Identifiers][STI].
